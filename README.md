# Machine-Learning-Approaches-for-Land-Use-Land-Cover-Classification
This  project  explores the application of machine learning algorithms in identifying and mapping different land cover types using satellite  imagery and  compares the performance of  algorithms.

## Abstract
This project investigates machine learning (ML) techniques for land use and land cover (LULC) classification across the Moehne Reservoir region in Germany using Python and open-source Sentinel-2 satellite data. By employing ML algorithms, this study evaluates the performance of these methods for identifying LULC changes and selects the most effective algorithm. The flexible, scalable framework demonstrated in this study achieves notable accuracy in LULC categorization, underscoring its critical role in regional and national-scale monitoring.
