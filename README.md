# Machine-Learning-Approaches-for-Land-Use-Land-Cover-Classification
This  project  explores the application of machine learning algorithms in identifying and mapping different land cover types using satellite  imagery and  compares the performance of  algorithms.

## Abstract
This project investigates machine learning (ML) techniques for land use and land cover (LULC) classification across the [Moehne Reservoir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6hne_Reservoir#:~:text=The%20M%C3%B6hne%20Reservoir%2C%20or%20Moehne,million%20cubic%20metres%20of%20water) region in Germany using Python and open-source Sentinel-2 satellite data. By employing ML algorithms, this study evaluates the performance of these methods for identifying LULC changes and selects the most effective algorithm. The flexible, scalable framework demonstrated in this project achieves good accuracy in LULC categorization, underscoring its critical role in regional and national-scale monitoring.

## Introduction

### 1.1 Project Background
LULC classification is a fundamental process in environmental science, involving the identification and mapping of various surface features such as vegetation, water bodies, urban infrastructure, and bare land. Understanding and monitoring LULC is crucial for effective environmental management, urban planning, agriculture, and biodiversity conservation. These classifications serve as the foundation for assessing changes in land cover over time, which is essential for tracking the impact of human activities and natural phenomena on ecosystems.
Traditional methods of LULC classification, including manual and rule-based approaches, often struggle to accurately capture the complexities of spectral and spatial patterns in heterogeneous landscapes. The Moehne Reservoir region exemplifies such diversity, with a mix of forests, water bodies, agricultural fields, and urban areas that challenge traditional classification models.
To address these limitations, this study employs machine learning algorithms, which offer the capability to model non-linear relationships and leverage high-dimensional datasets effectively. By analyzing Sentinel-2 imagery using ML techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Trees (DT), this project identifies the most effective method for LULC classification in the region. Additionally, it evaluates these algorithms to determine the most reliable and scalable solution for assessing land use changes. The findings contribute to the advancement of robust, data-driven methodologies for LULC analysis and support informed decision-making in land management and policy development.
