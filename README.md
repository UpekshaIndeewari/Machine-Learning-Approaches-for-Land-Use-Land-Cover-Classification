## Application of Google Earth Engine (GEE) for Landuse Classification and Monitoring Change Detection

This project utilizes Sentinel-2 imagery and the computational power of GEE to classify land use and detect temporal changes in the MÃ¼nster region of Germany. By integrating remote sensing indices like NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and NDBI (Normalized Difference Built-up Index) with machine learning techniques, especially the Random Forest classifier, this study aims to perform accurate land use classification and monitor landscape transformations from 2016 to 2023. The outcomes contribute to a deeper understanding of regional land use trends, particularly urban expansion, vegetation changes, and water resource shiftsâ€”insights that are crucial for informed decision-making in land resource management.

- **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** is a cloud-based geospatial processing platform that enables large-scale analysis of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. It provides powerful tools for data access, preprocessing, visualization, and the implementation of machine learning algorithms, making it ideal for land use classification and change detection. GEE supports scripting and automation of spatial analysis tasks using both JavaScript and Python APIs, streamlining the processing of multi-temporal satellite data such as Sentinel-2. 
- **ArcGIS Pro** was utilized to visualize and analyze the classified land use maps exported from GEE. It facilitated the calculation of land cover area statistics and the creation of high-quality cartographic outputs for presentation and interpretation.
